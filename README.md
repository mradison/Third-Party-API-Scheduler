# Third-Party-API-Scheduler

I made changes to the starter code to create a calendar so people can easily see what day it is. They can also tell which items of their day are in the past, present and future. There is also a way to save their tasks for each hour of the day. 

## Instructions 

Add what task you have each hour of the day and then click the saved button so the data with retain and be there when you refresh the page.

## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
